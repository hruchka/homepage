# Homepage
My very own personal website. Basically this is just a résumé.

# Overview
It's important for employees to know you have the necessary experience to do the work required in the position. Still, many candidates will have this relevant experience. This example of résumé will totally help you to stand out.

# How To Use
This Résumé is an MIT-licensed open-source project. It's an independent project with ongoing development made possible thanks to the help of **Binary Studio Academy**. This page is hosted on [**GitHub Pages**](https://pages.github.com/), which makes it much easier to use.
